 About Me : 
New technology, and particularly web development, always fascinates me since I earned my diploma in general IT! I made the decision to further my knowledge in web technologies. Since then, I've built websites for family and friends, and before I knew it, I was earning a living by designing simple websites and logos for clients online! Although front-end development is my primary area of interest, I'm always willing to learn new skills because programming is unlike any other profession in that you can never stop learning! and that's the FUN PART!
