 About Me : 
New technology, and particularly web development, always fascinates me since I earned my diploma in general IT! I made the decision to further my knowledge in web technologies. Since then, I've built websites for family and friends, and before I knew it, I was earning a living by designing simple websites and logos for clients online! Although web development is my primary area of interest, I'm always willing to learn new skills because programming is unlike any other profession in that you can never stop learning! and that's the FUN 
PART!


Beyond IT, I love learning foreign languages. I'm fluent in four languages: Arabic (my native tongue), French, English, and German. This linguistic ability enhances both my personal life and professional interactions.
I'm consistently open to new challenges, whether in programming or language learning. This adaptability drives my growth in both my career and personal pursuits.
